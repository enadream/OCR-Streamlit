## Key Features

* **Dual Applications:** A single interface provides access to two distinct apps: a PDF OCR Extractor and a Synthetic PDF Generator.
* **Multi-Engine & Multi-Language OCR:** Choose between Tesseract and EasyOCR. Supports multiple languages including English and Turkish.
* **Intelligent Layout Detection:** Automatically identifies text blocks and images, assigning each a unique, searchable ID.
* **Visual Debugging:** Displays a labeled view of the processed page with colored bounding boxes for each detected content region.
* **AI-Powered Spell Correction:** Uses language-specific spaCy models to significantly improve the accuracy of raw OCR text.
* **Configurable Synthetic Data:** Generate realistic "scanned" documents by applying adjustable artifacts like blur, skew, noise, and ink smudges.
* **Interactive UI:** A clean and user-friendly web interface built with Streamlit, featuring page-specific searching and configurable options.

## Project Content

The application is a suite composed of two main tools accessible from the sidebar.

### App 1: Synthetic PDF Generator

This tool is designed to create realistic test data for OCR models. It takes a clean, digital PDF and applies a series of augmentations to simulate the artifacts commonly found in scanned documents.

The process is as follows:
1.  **PDF to Image Conversion:** The source PDF is converted into a sequence of high-resolution images.
2.  **Artifact Augmentation:** Each image is processed to add random, configurable artifacts, including Gaussian Blur, Perspective Skew, Noise, Ink Smudges, and Brightness/Contrast Jitter.
3.  **PDF Re-assembly:** The newly augmented images are combined into a final, synthetic PDF that looks like a real-world scanned document.

### App 2: PDF OCR Extractor

This is the core extraction engine that digitizes PDF documents. The pipeline is designed for accuracy and usability.

**Pipeline Explanation:**
1.  **PDF Ingestion & Page Selection:** The user uploads a PDF and can specify which pages to process (e.g., `all`, `1, 5`, `2-8`).
2.  **Image Conversion & Preprocessing:** The selected PDF pages are converted to images, and a skew correction algorithm is applied to straighten text lines.
3.  **Layout Analysis & ID Generation:** The system analyzes the page layout to differentiate text vs. image regions and assigns a unique, sequential ID to each (e.g., `text_1`, `image_1`).
4.  **Multi-Engine OCR:** Text is extracted from the detected blocks using either Tesseract or EasyOCR.
5.  **AI-Powered Correction:** Raw text is passed through a language-specific spaCy model to correct spelling and other common OCR errors.
6.  **Interactive Results:** The final output is displayed in the UI, showing a labeled debug image and searchable content expanders corresponding to each ID.
